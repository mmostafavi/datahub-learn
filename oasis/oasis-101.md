# ✏ Oasis 101

## **What is Oasis?**

Designed for the next generation of blockchain, the Oasis Network is the first privacy-enabled blockchain platform for open finance and a responsible data economy. Combined with its high throughput and secure architecture, the Oasis Network is able to power private, scalable DeFi, revolutionizing Open Finance and expanding it beyond traders and early adopters to a mass market. Its unique privacy features can not only redefine DeFi, but also create a new type of digital asset called Tokenized Data that can enable users to take control of the data they generate and earn rewards for staking it with applications — creating the first ever responsible data economy.

### **Why build on Oasis?**

**First Privacy-Enabled Blockchain:** The Oasis Network is the world’s first scalable, privacy-enabled blockchain. ParaTimes on the Oasis Network can leverage confidential computing technology such as secure enclaves to keep data confidential — unlocking new use cases and applications for blockchain.

**Scalable, Private DeFi:** The Oasis Network’s privacy-first design can expand DeFi beyond traders and early adopters — unlocking a new mainstream market. Plus its innovative scalability design brings fast speeds and high-throughput to DeFi transactions.

**First to Enable Data Tokenization:** The Oasis Network can **Tokenize Data**, unlocking game changing use cases for blockchain, and an entirely new ecosystem of apps and projects on the network — powering the next generation of privacy-first applications.

**Rapidly Growing Community:** The Oasis Network has a thriving community of close to a thousand node operators, developers, enterprise partners, ambassadors, and nearly ten thousand community members engaged in global social channels.

### **What can you build on Oasis?**

**Scalable, Private DeFi**

The Oasis Network is designed to support confidential smart contracts, allowing it to keep data private while being processed. By providing end-to-end data confidentiality on Blockchain, the Oasis Network unlocks new and exciting use cases in DeFi. From under-collateralized lending to preventing front/back running, the Oasis Network can help expand DeFi beyond traders and early adopters to a mainstream market.

The network’s cutting-edge scalable features can help unblock DeFi as it works today, fixing the high-transaction fees and slow throughput currently plaguing other Layer 1 networks. Combined, Oasis’ unique ability to provide scalable, private DeFi is expected to make it the leading platform for unlocking the next generation of DeFi markets and use cases.

**Data Tokenization & A Responsible Data Economy**

The Oasis Network’s combination of confidential computing and blockchain enables a new paradigm called Tokenized Data. Blockchain allows for logging and enforcement of usage policies with high integrity and auditability. Confidential computing ensures that data remains private during computation and cannot be reused without permission. This capsule of data + policies creates a new kind of digital asset that can be consumed along specific guidelines for a specific fee or exchange of value.

With Tokenized Data, the Oasis Network can power the next generation of privacy-first applications and unlock a new responsible data society. Data providers on the Oasis Network can put their Tokenized Data to use. They can earn rewards by staking their data with apps that want to analyze it or control how their most sensitive information is consumed by the services they use.

## **Network Specifications**

### **Transaction Fees**

Transaction fees are currently paid in the native token, the ROSE. Since Oasis can handle many transactions quickly and the demand for transactions is low, the current cost of Oasis transactions is very low \(ie. almost nothing\).

### **Transaction Speed & Finality**

Oasis is built on the Tendermint BFT which typically have block times between 1 and 8 seconds, and can handle up to thousands of transactions per second.

A property of the Tendermint consensus algorithm is instant finality. This means that forks are never created as long as more than a third of the validators are honest \([Byzantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault)\). Users can be sure that their transactions are finalized as soon as a block is created, unlike Proof-of-Work blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

### **Languages supported**

The Oasis Devnet supports [Rust for smart contract development](https://docs.oasiscloud.io/en/latest/rust-contract-tutorial/). The support for Rust paves the way to support additional programming languages and frameworks in the future. That’s because under the hood, Rust smart contracts compile to WebAssembly \(WASM\) which execute inside a WASM runtime on the Oasis Devnet.

### **EVM compatibility**

While Oasis is not directly compatible with the EVM, the Oasis Foundation has partnered with [Second State](https://www.secondstate.io/) to all existing Ethereum smart contracts and DApps, including DeFi and DEX apps, to run on the Oasis Network. The [Second State VM \(SSVM\)](https://www.secondstate.io/ssvm/) is a fully-featured Ethereum WebAssembly \(Ewasm\) Virtual Machine.

On the Oasis Network, the SSVM Ewasm runtime will operate in parallel along other ParaTimes connected to the Oasis Network and provide an easy-to-use development environment for smart contracts written in Solidity, YUL, Vyper, Rust, and other common blockchain programming languages. The SSVM is also [a powerful runtime for general cloud computing](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/getting-started-with-rust-function/) applications. Using SSVM, developers will be able to deploy smart contracts on the Oasis Network using programming languages and toolchains they are already familiar with.

### **Role of the ROSE token**

The primary token for the Oasis Network, ROSE fuels all transactions, staking, and delegation on the Oasis Network.
