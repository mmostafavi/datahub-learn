# Introduction

In order to benefit from the full potential of the Terra blockchain, you will first need to connect to a Terra node. 

In this tutorial, we will use the Terra SDK to connect to a Terra node hosted by ****[**DataHub**](https://figment.io/datahub-waitlist/). We will be building a simple Nodejs application, which we will develop further during the Terra Pathway. 

More details about Terra.js can be found [**here**](https://terra-project.github.io/terra.js/).

## **Creating the NodeJS App**

Before we can jump in and start using the Terra SDK, we need to set up our project and all required dependencies. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Please make sure that you have Node 10+ installed on your machine.
{% endhint %}

The next step is to create a directory for your project where you will initialize the new Nodejs project. You can do this using the following command:

```javascript
npm init
```

You will then be prompted with several questions. For the purpose of this tutorial, you can safely press `Enter` for every one of these questions \(which will create `package.json` with the default options\). This should create a `package.json` file in the root of your directory that looks similar to:

```javascript
{
  "name": "terra",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
   }
}
```

## **Installing packages**

Now that we have our Nodejs application set up we can install the required packages:  


* **dotenv** - for keeping sensitive data
* **terra.js** - Terra SDK

```javascript
npm install --save dotenv @terra-money/terra.js
```

## **Store sensitive data**

When we have that out of our way, we can continue by creating an `.env` file which will hold all our sensitive data.

You should never commit this file to a git repository so make sure to create a `.gitignore` file and the following command:

```javascript
.env
```

Now open `.env` file and add the first environmental variables:

* **TERRA\_NODE\_URL** - url to DH Tequila node
* **TERRA\_CHAIN\_ID** - chain id which should be set to `tequila-0004`

Your `.env` file should look similar to:

```javascript
TERRA_NODE_URL='https://tequila-0004--lcd--archive.datahub.figment.io/apikey/<YOUR API KEY>/'
TERRA_CHAIN_ID='tequila-0004'
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Warning! Make sure that you donâ€™t forget about the trailing slash for the TERRA\_NODE\_URL**
{% endhint %}

## **Conclusion**

Now that we have successfully connected to a Terra node using [**DataHub**](https://figment.io/datahub-waitlist/), we are ready to move on to the next tutorial.

## **Next steps**

In the next tutorial, we will be creating your very first Terra account using the Terra SDK.
