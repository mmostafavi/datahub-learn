# What is Solana?

Solana is an open-source project implementing a new, high-performance, permissionless blockchain. The Solana Foundation is based in Geneva, Switzerland and maintains the open-source project. Its goal is to provide a platform that enables developers to create DApps without needing to design around performance bottlenecks. Solana features a new timestamp system called Proof-of-History (PoH) that enables automatically ordered transactions. It also uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm to help secure the network. Additional design goals include sub-second settlement times, low transaction costs, and support for all LLVM compatible smart contract languages.

# **What can you build on Solana?**

Solana offers a highly scalable platform for Web 3 applications which can now unlock mainstream usage. There are already over 150 projects live on Solana, with a majority of DeFi projects, although NFTs, social apps, and games are starting to launch on the network.

# **The Solana network**

* **Transaction Fees** The network Cluster sets transaction fees based on recent processing history. Transaction fees on Solana are estimated at $10 for 1 million transactions.
* **Transaction Speed & Finality** : Solana can manage up to 65,000 transactions per second and block times at 400ms. This makes Solana one of the fastest production blockchain available, and 4,000 times faster than Ethereum.
* **Languages supported** : Solana applications are built on Rust, but also support C and C++.
* **EVM compatibility** : Solana is not EVM compatible but it offers [a bidirectional token bridge](https://solana.com/wormhole) between Solana and Ethereum so projects can move tokenized assets across blockchains.
* **Role of the SOL token** : The token is used to pay for the transaction fees in the network and to reward participant in the Proof of Stake consensus
