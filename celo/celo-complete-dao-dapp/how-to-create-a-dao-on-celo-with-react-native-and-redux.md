# Build a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on Celo.

In this tutorial, we will build a functioning DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organization) by first writing the Solidity smart contract code which will be deployed on the Celo network and then building a React Native App to interact with the smart contract.

&nbsp;

# Introduction.

## What is a DAO? 

> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) defines DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) as an organization represented as rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. It decides which decision will be made by a decentralized organization. 

In non-technical terms: **DAOs are an effective and safe way to work with like-minded folks around the globe**.

Think of DAOs like an internet-native business that’s collectively owned and managed by its members. They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice.

There’s no CEO who can authorize spending based on their own whims and no chance of a dodgy CFO manipulating the books. Everything is out in the open and the rules around spending are baked into the DAO via its code.

>In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a functioning Charity DAO. The smart contract code is deployed on the Alfajores testnet of the Celo network. The contract allows its members to contribute to the DAO. Members can initiate charity proposals which Stakeholders will have to vote on within a specified period of time. After that time has elapsed, the DAO contract will disburse the pooled funds.

# Prerequisite

This article assumes that you have basic knowledge of Solidity, JavaScript (TypeScript), and also how to start a React Native App using [expo](https://expo.io/). It is also assumed that you have read the expo documentation and have basic knowledge of the Celo Wallet.

- [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) is a framework and a platform for universal React applications.
- Learn about the Celo [mobile wallet](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/alfajores-testnet/using-the-mobile-wallet).
- React Native using [expo](https://docs.expo.io/).
- The Celo DappKit [documentation](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/dappkit/setup) is also going to be useful.
- Learn about [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) as well.

&nbsp;

# Requirements
For this tutorial, following software needs to be installed:
- React Native
- NodeJS v12 and above
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
- The Alfajores Wallet, which will need to be funded using the [faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet)

We will cover the project in three parts: 
- Solidity smart contracts on Celo
- Create a React Native app
- Bringing it together with Redux

&nbsp;

We will begin by outlining a visual representation of the dApp, its features, and the various screens used in interacting with the smart contract.

# Features
The functionality of the dApp includes: 
- Users connect their Celo Wallet to join the Charity DAO.
* Users send Celo tokens to the DAO to become Contributors.
- Contributors that have made 200 or more total contributions are automatically made Stakeholders.
* Only a Stakeholder of the DAO can vote on proposals.
- Contributors and/or Stakeholders can create a new proposal.
* A newly created proposal has an ending date, when voting will conclude.
- Stakeholders can upvote or downvote a proposal.
* Once a Proposal's expiry date passes, a Stakeholder then pays out the requested amount to the specified Charity.

&nbsp;

This is the overview introduction to the project. The next sections are categorized into 3 parts
- Writing the DAO Smart Contract in Solidity, where we go over the methods used.
- Building the React Native App, in which we show you how to quickly put together a mobile app interface.
- Connecting the React Native App to the Smart Contract using Redux, which brings it all together and allows our mobile dApp to utilize Celo efficiently.
